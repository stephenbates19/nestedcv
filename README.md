Nested cross-validation for accurate confidence intervals for prediction error.

This method was introduced in the paper
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00673](“Cross-validation: what does it estimate and how well does it do it?”)
by Stephen Bates, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani.

To install, run
```
	devtools::install_github("stephenbates19/nestedcv")
```

Two vignettes showing basic usage are included.

The numerical experiments from the paper can be found at
